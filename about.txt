DeepAProt is a deep learning-based software/tool for classifying and identifying abiotic stress protein sequences for cereal crops. We used a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) architecture. The software is able to accurately classify and identify abiotic stress proteins with high accuracy. DeepAProt is a valuable tool for researchers and breeders to quickly identify and characterize abiotic stress proteins in grain. The software is developed by Dr. Bulbul Ahmed, Dr. Md Ashraful Haque, Dr. Mir Asif Iquebal, Dr. Sarika Jaiswal, Dr. U. B. Angadi, Dr. Dinesh Kumar and Dr. Anil Rai at Division of Agricultural Bioinformatics, ICAR-Indian Agricultural Statistics Research Institute, New Delhi.
